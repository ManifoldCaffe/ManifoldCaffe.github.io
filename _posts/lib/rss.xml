Proposition: Let  is a complete divisible metric space generated measure space;  is a transitive probability measure family, then we can construct a measure space  and a Markov process , s.t. 

**Proof**: We use Kolmogorov theorem to construct probability space. For this, let $\Omega = \mathscr S^T$, $\mathscr C$ is the family of finite dimension measurable sets on $\Omega$, $\mathscr F = \sigma(\mathscr C)$. For $\forall t_1 &lt; t_2 &lt; \dots &lt; t_n \in T$ and $\forall \tilde A \in \Sigma^n$. Let
$$
F_{t_1, \dots, t_n}(\tilde A) = \int p_0(\mathrm{d} x_0) \int p(0, x_0; t_1, \mathrm d x_1) \cdots \int p(t_{n - 1}, x_{n - 1}; t_n, \mathrm d x_n) \chi_{\tilde A}.
